# InClass

InClass is a website designed for making teacher's lives easier when taking attendance. It's designed to make the process fast for teachers
and intuitive and simple for the students. The website allows teachers to generate reusable QR codes for each of their classes, and allowing
the students to quickly scan said code to mark themselves presents in class. The list of present students can be then exported and sent to the
school for record keeping.
